# Mini Compiler Project (Lex & Yacc)

This project is a simple educational mini-compiler developed using **Lex (Flex)** and **Yacc (Bison)**. It reads input code, identifies tokens, checks the syntax based on grammar rules, and then reports whether the program is valid or contains errors.

**What it does:**
- Performs lexical analysis (token recognition).
- Performs syntax analysis (grammar validation).
- Provides clear success or error output.
