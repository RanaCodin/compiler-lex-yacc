Mini Compiler Project (Lex & Yacc)
This project is a simple mini-compiler created for learning purposes. It uses Lex to detect tokens and Yacc to check grammar rules. The compiler reads an input program, analyzes its structure, and reports whether the syntax is valid.
My role in the project: I organized the structure of the project, reviewed the grammar, and tested multiple input cases to ensure correctness.
